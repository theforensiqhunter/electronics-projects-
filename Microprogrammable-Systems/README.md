# üñ•Ô∏è Microprogrammable Equipment Projects

This folder contains projects related to the **design and implementation of electronic circuits** using microprogrammable devices such as microcontrollers and programmable logic.

## üîπ What‚Äôs Inside?
- Designs of embedded systems
- Circuit simulations
- Implementation of programmable control systems

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

### **Proteus**
For many of these projects, **Proteus** has been used.  
Proteus is a powerful electronic design automation (EDA) tool that allows:
- **Circuit simulation** for both analog and digital systems
- **Microcontroller emulation** (such as Arduino, PIC, and ARM-based systems)
- Real-time debugging and visualization of how circuits behave

These capabilities make it an essential tool for testing and validating designs before physically building them.
